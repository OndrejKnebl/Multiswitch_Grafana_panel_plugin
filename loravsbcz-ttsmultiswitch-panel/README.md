# Fair Use Policy
On The Things Networkâ€™s public community network a Fair Use Policy applies which limits the uplink airtime to 30 seconds per day (24 hours) per node and the downlink messages to 10 messages per day (24 hours) per node. If you use a private network, these limits do not apply, but you still have to be compliant with the governmental and LoRaWAN limits.
